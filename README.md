# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover key trends and patterns. The goal is to provide actionable information that can support data-driven decision-making.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset related to customer and sales data. The dataset contains information about customer details and the products they bought.

## Methods

The following methods were used in this EDA project:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Data Transformation:** Feature engineering, data type conversions, and scaling.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Statistical summaries, distributions, and relationships between variables.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to visualize patterns and trends.

## Libraries Used

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating basic visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For creating advanced and informative statistical graphics.
